## 📖 Overview

This project explores the application of various **machine learning classifiers** on a dataset, focusing on how **feature selection** and **dimensionality reduction** can influence model performance.  

### ✨ Key Topics Covered:
1. **📋 Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling and cleaning the dataset.  
   - Selecting features using techniques like **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** or **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**.  

2. **🤖 Machine Learning Classifiers**  
   - **Logistic Regression**  
   - **Decision Tree**  
   - **Random Forest**  
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

3. **📉 Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - Retains the most relevant features while removing noise and redundancy.  
   - Helps to prevent overfitting and improves generalization.  

4. **📊 Performance Metrics**  
   - Models evaluated on **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.  
   - Comparative analysis of the **full dataset** vs. the **feature-reduced dataset**.

## 🔍 Results Summary

### 🚀 Full Dataset Performance:
- **Higher Accuracy**: Utilizes all features, capturing more information.  
- **Potential Overfitting**: Increased complexity can lead to poor generalization on unseen data.

### 🎯 Feature-Reduced Dataset Performance:
- **Improved Generalization**: Simplified models are less prone to overfitting.  
- **Training Efficiency**: Reduced computational requirements.  
- **Slightly Lower Accuracy**: A trade-off for better interpretability and robustness.
